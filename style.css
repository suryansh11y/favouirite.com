        <p >My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 11 years old and read in class 6th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.</p>

<h1>My favourite book</h1>
    <p id="book">My favourite book - Things Fall Apart</p>
<p>I love too many books to pick a favourite, but I really loved reading Things Fall Apart by Nigerian author Chinua Achebe. It is a realistic historical fiction novel published in 1958, two years before Nigeria was free from British colonization. 

A major reason why I love the book is because of its narrative – it uses a unique narrative to tell the story of the main character Okonkwo and his life in the fictional village of Umuofia before and after being colonized by the British. 

Chinua Achebe’s goal when writing the book was so that it would serve as a story from which young Nigerians could learn about their past, while at the same time embracing their new future after independence. 

Achebe wanted to convey the importance of duality- the concept of maintaining your core ideals while changing to accommodate a world which is also constantly changing.

The book tells Okonkwo’s story from his perspective, making him the main protagonist. It is divided into two halves – the first half explores Okonkwo’s present and past, helping readers understand his personality and inability to adjust to changing situations. 

In the second half, we see this inflexibility manifest as he refuses to accept his authority being stripped away when the British take over Umuofia. His inability to handle change takes a major toll on his mental health, leading to the complete deterioration of his psyche at the end of the novel. </p>
